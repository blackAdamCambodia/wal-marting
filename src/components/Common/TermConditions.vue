                <p>8.5 wal-marting acknowledges the manufacturer's right to enter into certain exclusive distribution
                    agreements or minimum advertising price agreements for its products. However, violation of such
                    agreements does not constitute infringement of intellectual property rights. As the enforcement of
                    these agreements is a matter between the manufacturer and the seller, wal-marting does not assist in
                    such enforcement activities, nor does wal-marting enforce exclusive distribution rights or price
                    control matters, except in countries/territories where laws specifically govern selectivity. Or
                    exclusive distribution.</p>
