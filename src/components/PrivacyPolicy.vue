                <p>The risk of loss</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>All physical purchases from SHEIN are made according to the delivery contract. This means that the
                    risk of loss and ownership of such items passes to you when we deliver them to the carrier.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Returns, refunds, and titles</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>SHEIN does not acquire title to returned items until they arrive at our fulfillment center. In our
                    judgment, a refund can be issued without requiring a return. In this case, SHEIN will not receive
                    title to the refunded item. For more information about our returns and refunds, please refer to our
                    Return Center.</p>

                <p><br></p>
                <p>SHEIN tried to be accurate. However, SHEIN does not warrant that the product description or other
                    content of any SHEIN Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. If SHEIN itself
                    offers a product that does not match the description, your only remedy is to return it in an unused
                    state.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>The price</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>"List Price" means the suggested retail price of the product provided by the manufacturer, supplier
                    or seller. We regularly check the list prices based on recent prices found at SHEIN and other
                    retailers. Certain products may display "original price," which is determined using the most recent
                    price history for that item on SHEIN.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>For items sold by SHEIN, we cannot confirm prices until you place an order. Despite our best efforts,
                    a few items in our catalogue may be mispriced. If the correct price for an item sold by SHEIN is
                    higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, contact you for instructions prior to
                    shipment or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. If an item is mispriced, other
                    merchants may follow a different policy.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>We generally do not charge your credit card before your order enters the shipping process, or for
                    digital products, until after we have provided you with the digital product.</p>

                    us certain permissions on your device. Most mobile devices will provide you with information about
                    these permissions. To learn more about these permissions, click here.</p>
